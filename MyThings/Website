	A poem website where people can write, read, and comment is concise and clear.
	The poems express their thoughts, feelings, and emotions.
Goal
	This project demonstrates that we can create a website quickly, which requires both front-end and back-end technical skills.
Potential Influence
	This try is a comprehensive process to serve users. It is great! There will be someone who likes our site. I believe it.
Deployment
	The website can be deployed on a cloud server, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Aliyun, or Volcano. We may need to address the Nginx and PHP servers. This process will take some effort.
