现在的问题就是要解决Job的问题，职业生涯怎么办。当然不可能一蹴而就，但是方向我们要定好，然后脚踏实地去做。
Freelancer是一个方向，我对Coding的热情还是在的。
去录一些视频，写一些博客，分享一些知识，这是我目前的计划。

The current issue is to address the problem of my career. What should I do with my career path? Of course, it can't be achieved overnight, 
but we need to set the right direction and then work diligently towards it. 
Freelancing is one option, as I still have a passion for coding.

弃我去者，昨日之日不可留。
乱我心者，今日之日多烦忧。
